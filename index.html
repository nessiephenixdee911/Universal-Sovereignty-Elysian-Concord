    <h1>UNIVERSAL SOVEREIGNTY ELYSIAN CONCORD</h1>
  </div>

  <div id="box">
The Universal Sovereignty Elysian Concord is the global movement to end all governments and replace them with self-governance under one law: Do No Harm — our natural law rights written at the beginning of time in God's holy scriptures. 
<p> 
When 51% majority is reached in required divisions (at least half the provinces/states/territories of a nation vote YES), borders, taxes, prisons, and wars end forever. Sacred Healing Councils rise. Human rights are absolute non-debatable. Vote now to make humanity free.
<p> 
The Recall and Initiative Act – that’s the law that lets us do this. The petitition that then forces the vote then then forces legislation. We can do this on our own with funding to hold our own election. It’s not polite and it’s not a suggestion. It says: If ten percent of every voter in every single one of the province’s eighty-seven districts signs the same sheet of paper – the same idea – the government has two choices.
<p>
 That’s the hammer. We don’t ask. We force. We’re using that hammer right now to draft and push the Universal Sovereignty Elysian Concord – the rule that says you own yourself, your body, your land, your data, your voice. No more begging permission.
<p>
  Once a Province approves the bill, the language doesn’t stay local. We copy the section. Word. Sentence. Clause. Same percentages, same power.
 Ten percent is ten percent in every language. Every Region. Every Nation. Every Continent. When enough of us speak up, the system if forced to boot up running our rules, not theirs.
  <p>
      Please sign this petition to make humanity free and bring about a lasting transformation in how we live and govern. Together, we can build a future where all humans thrive in liberty and peace.
<p>
 That’s not poetry. That’s protocol.

    <p>Old world ends at threshold.</p>

    <p>We stop obeying.</p>
 
        <p>Mandating Legislation of the Universal Elysian Concord adapting into a Universal Sovereign Peace Tribe as a Humanitarian whole:</p>

        <p>Global legislation in each Nation mandates adoption in each sovereign nation by at least half of its total number of Provinces, States, Territories or equivalent first level administrative divisions. Adoption within each division requires a majority vote of 51% majority vote. Although establishing such a threshold may appear inequitable at first glance, it is none the less the bare minimum to satisfy due process without demanding impossible supermajority consensus. A three quarter of the population approval rate – while morally tempting – has consistently proven unworkable in practice. Such a drawn out process, left unchecked becomes Negligent to humankind justice, to stay alive, must move quick – and equal. This, therefore, is how it prevails.</p>

        <h2>Preamble</h2>

        <p>We, the peoples of the world, exercising our inalienable and original constituent power—the same sovereign power that has founded every legitimate government and constitution throughout history; that compelled the Magna Carta (1215); that inspired the writings of John Locke (Second Treatise of Government, 1689); that animated the American Declaration of Independence (1776) and the words of Thomas Jefferson; that shaped the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, Article Two (1789); that was articulated by Emmanuel Sieyès (1789); that is enshrined in modern constitutional provisions worldwide, including Germany’s Basic Law Article 20(4), New Hampshire’s State Constitution Part I Article 10, Portugal’s Constitution Article 21, Greece’s Constitution Article 120(4), and similar provisions in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Honduras, Cuba, and approximately 42 nations in total; that is affirmed in the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights Article 20(2); and that is expressly recognised in the Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)—do hereby solemnly declare and reaffirm the eternal truths upon which all lawful authority rests:</p>

        <p>That governments derive their legitimacy solely from the protection of the inherent dignity, life, bodily integrity, and equal rights of all members of the human family, as well as the living systems of the Earth;</p>

        <p>That this principle of “do no harm” is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world, as recognised since time immemorial and expressly affirmed in the writings of John Locke (1689), the American Declaration of Independence (1776), and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), which states:</p>

        <p>“Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world…</p>

        <p>Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind…</p>

        <p>Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law”;</p>

        <p>That whenever any government, law, act, or treaty—domestic, federal, or international—systematically violates this founding principle by causing or permitting harm to life, dignity, bodily integrity, or the Earth, it becomes destructive of the very ends for which it was instituted, thereby forfeiting all claim to legitimacy and obedience;</p>

        <p>That in such circumstances, the people retain the ultimate and inalienable constituent power—affirmed by Emmanuel Sieyès (1789) and enshrined in modern constitutional provisions worldwide—to withdraw consent, to alter or abolish destructive structures, and to re-found the legal order upon the original purpose of law: the protection of humanity;</p>

        <p>Therefore, we declare that any law, act, or treaty which violates the principle of “do no harm” is, from the moment of its effect, null, void, and stripped of all legitimacy.</p>

        <p>We now draw the line.</p>

        <p>The transparent and verifiable attainment of a fifty-one percent majority vote in at least half (rounded up) of each nation’s first-level administrative divisions (provinces, states, territories, or equivalents) shall constitute conclusive and irrefutable proof that the people have spoken, that governance has failed its sole purpose, and that consent has been withdrawn. Global legislation in each Nation mandates adoption in each sovereign nation by at least half of its total number of Provinces, States, Territories or equivalent first level administrative divisions. Adoption within each division requires a majority vote of 51% majority vote.</p>

        <p>This is not a private referendum seeking permission.</p>

        <p>This is the lawful exercise of original constituent power revoking legitimacy from that which betrays humanity’s reason for having law at all. It is the legal order governments wrote for themselves when they needed bodies in the streets.</p>

        <p>Picture it: half a country, or seven whole nations, tap the screen and say, Your rules no longer bind us. That is mass withdrawal of consent on a scale no parliament can outvote. Governments lose power the instant the people quit nodding. Courts may bark injunctions; let them try arresting half a continent for existing—they will look like fools.</p>

        <p>The blockchain runs: timestamp, tally, tamper-proof. Legally they may scream “advisory”; spiritually, and in the only court that ultimately matters—history’s—it is already done.</p>

        <p>We do not declare victory. We simply stop obeying.</p>

        <p>No court, legislature, or treaty may deny this logic, for they have preached it themselves for centuries.</p>

        <p>This is how justice prevails: swiftly, equitably, and without permission.</p>

        <p>The principle that governments exist solely to protect human rights—and that the people have a right (or even duty) to resist or revolt when those rights are systematically violated—has been articulated by influential thinkers throughout history:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>John Locke (Second Treatise of Government, 1689):<br>
            “Whenever the legislators endeavour to take away and destroy the property of the people… the people are thereupon absolved from any further obedience… [They have] a right to resume their original liberty, and… establish a new legislative.”<br>
            Locke further states: “The people shall be judge… [and] have a right to resist… when they grow exorbitant in the use of their power, and employ it for the destruction, and not the preservation, of the properties of their people.”</li>

            <li>Thomas Jefferson (Letter to James Madison, 1787):<br>
            “I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical… God forbid we should ever be 20 years without such a rebellion.”</li>

            <li>Thomas Jefferson (Letter to William Smith, 1787):<br>
            “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.”</li>

            <li>American Declaration of Independence (1776, drafted by Jefferson):<br>
            “Governments are instituted among Men… to secure these rights… Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it.”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These ideas draw from natural law traditions, emphasizing that legitimate government rests on protecting life, liberty, dignity, and property. When it fails, consent is withdrawn, and resistance becomes justified.</p>

        <h2>References in Current Legislation Across the Globe</h2>

        <p>Today, approximately 42 countries explicitly recognize a constitutional right to resist tyranny, unconstitutional changes, or systematic human rights violations (often as a last resort when other remedies fail). This is most common in Latin America (post-coups), Europe (post-fascism), and Africa (post-colonial). Key examples:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Germany – Basic Law (Grundgesetz), Article 20(4) (added 1968):<br>
            “All Germans shall have the right to resist any person seeking to abolish this constitutional order if no other remedy is available.”<br>
            (Protected by the “eternity clause” in Article 79(3), making core principles unamendable.)</li>

            <li>New Hampshire, USA – State Constitution, Part I Article 10 (1784, still in force):<br>
            “Whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought to, reform the old, or establish a new government.”</li>

            <li>Portugal – Constitution, Article 21:<br>
            “Everyone has the right to resist any order that infringes their rights, freedoms or guarantees and to repel by force any aggression when recourse to public authority is impossible.”</li>

            <li>Greece – Constitution, Article 120(4):<br>
            “Observance of the Constitution is entrusted to the patriotism of the Greeks who shall have the right and the duty to resist by all possible means against anyone who attempts the violent abolition of the Constitution.”</li>

            <li>Czech Republic/Slovakia – Similar provisions allow resistance to attempts to abolish democratic order.</li>

            <li>Several Latin American constitutions (e.g., Honduras, Article 3; Cuba, Article 3) declare resistance legitimate against usurpation or tyranny.</li>

            <li>African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (1981, ratified by 54 African states), Article 20(2):<br>
            Colonized or oppressed peoples have the right “to free themselves from the bonds of domination by resorting to any means recognised by the international community.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>International Law Recognition</h2>

        <p>Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948, adopted by the UN General Assembly):<br>
        “Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.”</p>

        <p>This preamble acknowledges rebellion as a potential last resort if human rights are not protected, influencing global human rights norms.</p>

        <p>While international law does not grant an unrestricted “right to rebel,” it implies legitimacy in extreme cases (e.g., self-determination struggles or massive violations like genocide/crimes against humanity), provided actions comply with proportionality and humanitarian law.</p>

        <p>These historical and modern references substantiate that law and governance exist to protect humanity’s core rights—and failure justifies the people’s constituent power to withdraw consent and restore just order.</p>

        <h2>Article I: Name and Purpose</h2>

        <p>The movement shall be known as the Universal Sovereignty Elysian Concord (USEC).</p>

        <p>The purpose of the Universal Sovereignty Elysian Concord is to abolish all forms of systematic terrorism, human enslavement, trafficking, and wars through enforced adherence to "Do No Harm." Upon achieving majority support via blockchain referendum, it mandates the dissolution of harmful structures and institutes councils, peace forces, and healing systems to ensure compliance. Participation and enforcement are mandatory upon activation to protect humanity, overriding voluntary models where harm persists.</p>

        <p>We are done asking. We are done begging. We are DONE watching terror and hoping waiting for better days. The time for peace is NOW! Hell or High Water we ARE forcing back our Natural rights right freaking now! Today. Tomorrow. This Week. This Month. This Freaking year! NOW!</p>

        <p>Tonight the global shift to peace begins and terrorism is becoming a thing of the past.</p>

        <p>It is time to vote. Globally. Anonymously. Private-key blockchain vote will and IS ending every corrupt law on Earth.</p>

        <p>Global legislation in each Nation mandates adoption in each sovereign nation by at least half of its total number of Provinces, States, Territories or equivalent first level administrative divisions. Adoption within each division requires a majority vote of 51% majority vote.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Every border dissolves</li>
            <li>Every tax, mortgage, license, title, oath, prison, pharma poison dies instantly</li>
            <li>Every child is heard, every predator is removed, every family is reunited</li>
            <li>Land is free, guns are freely used, healing is free.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All movement is free because Liberty IS the state of being Free.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Councils of the people replace every government, court, and badge</li>
            <li>One law only: Do No Harm.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Everything else is love enforced by us as a one body familial humanity.</p>

        <p>No gods. No kings. No elites.</p>

        <p>Just sovereign humans ruling their own bodies and nothing else.</p>

        <p>This is not a petition.</p>

        <p>This is the kill-shot. This is the end of the beginning, and the shift to eternity, what we have all been waiting for and have always known would become in the 7,000 since humanities fall in this beautiful earth’s garden. When humans chose selfishness over selflessness, the degradion of natural rights incinerated. We dominion in full sincere selfless sovereignty.</p>

        <p>Vote. Tap YES. Majority wins, EVERY form of oppression becomes a thing of the past with its coffin firmly nailed shut and dig in the deepest of trench. War on humanity is coming to a halt. Right now.</p>

        <p>The old world ends the second we hit 51 %.</p>

        <p>We are not asking for our freedom.</p>

        <p>We are commanding it back tonight.</p>

        <p>Enough is enough.</p>

        <p>TERROR’S REIGN ENDS WITH ME.</p>

        <p>THE REIGN PEACE BEGINS NOW.</p>

        <p>Copy. Paste. Vote.</p>

        <p>The reckoning is here.</p>

        <p>The Universal Sovereignty Elysian Concord is live—private-key blockchain voting. No ID. No elites. Hit YES. Global legislation in each Nation mandates adoption in each sovereign nation by at least half of its total number of Provinces, States, Territories or equivalent first level administrative divisions. Adoption within each division requires a majority vote of 51% majority vote.—every law, every badge, every mortgage, every child adoption mill dies tonight. Councils rise. Land opens. Community vaults fill. Peace Force protects—love first, force only if threat to life is evident, lethal use of force is governable as our natural right to defend to the point of death. Kid’s voice rules as equally as Adults do. Harm ends. Eyes open. Ears open. Vote launches any second and stays open for 7 days or if majority gathers first. Share this. Now. We are not waiting. We are taking back everything stolen from us.</p>

        <h2>Article II: Philosophical Foundations</h2>

        <p>Every human being has equal moral agency.</p>

        <p>Every human being has a duty to intervene against imminent harm.</p>

        <p>Delegation to “trained elites” creates moral abdication.</p>

        <p>Outsourcing responsibility to the state has produced systemic failure.</p>

        <p>Self-defense — including lethal force when unavoidable — is a natural human right already recognized in criminal law.</p>

        <p>Children’s disclosures are sufficient to trigger protection, not something to be minimized or dismissed.</p>

        <h3>Universal Duty of Harm Interruption</h3>

        <p>Every human being possesses an equal moral and legal duty to intervene, within their capacity, to prevent imminent loss of life or severe bodily harm to another. This duty is inherent in human dignity and does not arise from rank, title, certification, or institutional delegation.</p>

        <h3>Child Disclosure Standard</h3>

        <p>A single disclosure by a child or vulnerable person is sufficient to trigger immediate protective intervention and safety measures. Determinations of guilt or long-term consequences require corroboration and lawful process, but protection does not wait for proof.</p>

        <h2>Article III: The Case That Ignited This Fire – Testimony of Daphne Ouellette</h2>

        <p>I, Daphne Ouellette, under penalty of perjury and in accordance with natural law principles of truth and transparency, do hereby testify to the following facts as the catalyst for the Universal Sovereignty Elysian Concord, demonstrating the systematic failure of existing legal, governmental, and societal systems to protect human life, dignity, and basic needs:</p>

        <p>For over twelve years, my daughter has been sexually abused by five publicly known pedophiles connected to organized crime. The evidence is overwhelming, including forensic documentation submitted to authorities. My best friend, who attempted to protect us, was murdered by gangs in retaliation for blocking the traffickers and preventing my murder. I have survived repeated assassination attempts, including direct threats and physical assaults. Every court, tribunal, and government agency has refused to act, sweeping the evidence under the rug and failing to vindicate the murder.</p>

        <p>Police have charged me as a pedophile for filing the forensic evidence proving the abuse. They arrested me for defending myself from a kidnapper, cuffing, starving, beating me, driving recklessly like assassins, and laughing when I begged for a seatbelt. Hospital staff drugged me, then allowed me to vanish for hours while police gang-raped me, returning me broken and heavily bruised with flashbacks of the encounter. No report was filed, no justice served, no headlines published. Daily, children are ripped from homes, sold through adoption systems, families torn apart, and elites pocket blood money—this is legal human trafficking masked as "care." This is the terror embedded in the system.</p>

        <p>All legislation over thousands of years has been fear-based, ego-driven, focused on controlling and manipulating the masses, suppressing humanity's sovereign roots. It protects criminals and shames victims; every "government" is orchestrated organized crime. We are DONE being raped by our criminal “government” in every form of sovereignty. No more. I am human. I will be treated as a Human being. Every soul will be treated as a human being. There is no going back. The mass has awoken. And the terror is exposed. And it ends now. Humanity now governs self. No fucking more!</p>

        <p>This testimony is further amplified by recent events as of December 2025 and January 2026, highlighting the ongoing dire threat and systemic negligence:</p>

        <p>On December 15, 2025, I received direct murder threats from my ex, Francois Alain, and his brother Sylvain Alain, involving an AK47 and grenade. They confessed to being murderers and threatened to bomb and shoot me. I submitted evidence to police, but they attempted to illegally arrest me under the mental health act to silence me, planning to admit me to Restigouche psychiatric jail to dope me up. A stranger provided safe harbor, as those I trusted ignored my pleas for $10 in gas money, leaving my vehicle to run out of gas on the highway while I waited in danger. Police stopped me, cursed when I mentioned evidence shared with others, and tried to seize my keys and detain me. The stranger advocated for me, forcing police to back off. I was transported in a ghost car to safety, but the investigating officer negligently failed to send a follow-up evidence link, limiting the upload and delaying arrests.</p>

        <p>On December 17, 2025, Francois contacted me anonymously, speaking gibberish to trace my location. The threats continued, with intruders spotted near my residence. Police arrested Francois but released him on conditions, yet the criminal court system remains negligent.</p>

        <p>Insurance from a car accident has denied basic income compensation despite my full disability, leaving me days from homelessness with no community or family support—everyone ignoring or abandoning me in this emergency. Society's selfishness has left me reliant on strangers and faith, facing death daily while fighting for my child's safety. My daughter remains in the care of her pedophile father, the source of these threats, with a long paper trail of evidence and witnesses proving repeated murder attempts, yet he evades accountability.</p>

        <p>These events prove the system's refusal to provide protection, support, or justice, pushing victims to the brink. The Universal Sovereignty Elysian Concord ends this pattern forever through mandatory sovereign reform.</p>

        <h2>Article IV: Activation and Blockchain Referendum</h2>

        <p>The Universal Sovereignty Elysian Concord activates upon a transparent, verifiable 51% majority YES vote in at least half (rounded up) of each nation’s first-level administrative divisions (provinces, states, territories, or equivalents) of any nation, conducted via private-key blockchain voting on open-source platforms (Ethereum/Tezos-style).</p>

        <p>Voters get private digital keys (cryptographic wallets) for anonymity/eligibility without personal data. Cast YES/NO as encrypted transaction; nodes validate via consensus (PoS/PoW). Once added, immutable—distributed ledger prevents tampering. Public/auditable: anyone verifies real-time; smart contracts tally, enforce 51% threshold automatically. Fraud-proof, accessible (phone/paper), efficient—no polling stations. Challenges: digital literacy, infrastructure; but pilots (Estonia e-voting, Sierra Leone elections) proves it works.</p>

        <p>In Universal Sovereignty Elysian Concord: unhackable, transparent—empowers people-power to override old systems. Every vote locks into public chain; thousands confirm in seconds. Result visible to all. 51% YES = smart contract triggers Global Accord Movement. No polling fraud. One person, one vote, one truth.</p>

        <p>Effective the instant 51% YES is reached in the required divisions. Their criminal rules used to abolish itself. Our victory. All old terror laws void on that day. We play their game and end it forever: Charlottetown 1992 demanded unanimity and died from elite vetoes. We weaponize their own 7/50 amending formula—the raw sovereign will of the people crushes the fraud. No Senate, no Queen, no premiers’ veto.</p>

        <p>Integrated safeguards: Rotation of referendum monitors, conflict-of-interest disclosures, live-streamed tallies and blockchain audits to prevent corruption.</p>

        <h2>Article V: Core Principles – The Ten Laws of Love</h2>

        <p>These are not rules handed down but stripped, raw, universal survival codes every atheist, agnostic, believer, or nobody can live by. Not punishment, not control, not fear—but a blueprint for alignment, energy mastery, integrity, unity, conscious creation, and restoring order within ourselves. A map back to source energy, quantum keys realigning humanity with the spark within. Love isn’t fluff—it’s the unbreakable boundary: do what keeps harm zero. Regardless of Cost. Full stop.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>No masters but yourself – you are the only authority in your life. Return to your inner source; no ego, addiction, money, corporation, government, or fear-system sits on your throne. No other masters exist.</li>
            <li>No symbols run you – burn flags, titles, badges, licenses, statutes: all empty paper illusions. Don’t worship symbols, structures, or idols; truth is the living spark within, not outside.</li>
            <li>Words are power – lie and you fracture trust and reality; speak truth or stay silent. Your tongue is a wand creating timelines; every lie, false oath, fraudulent contract bends reality—speak with intention and awareness.</li>
            <li>Rest weekly – unplug, reset, recalibrate; remember you’re not a machine. Stillness is the portal; one day in seven (or one breath in every moment) returns you to silence, allow you to hear your inner voice; Without this inner voice or inner compass, enslavement endures and natural sovereign rights collapse. Every being has these instinctual navigation of their consciousness, embodying health and accountability strengthens this to become unfaultable and unbreakable.</li>
            <li>Balance your own mind in logic (action, protection, discernment) and higher mind gut flow (intuition, creation, compassion): Logic and Higher Mind gut flow must run equal; If you abuse either, you will abuse yourself and others. When balanced, oppression, abuse, and war become impossible.</li>
            <li>No destruction – don’t destroy bodies, possessions, habitats, spirits, hopes, potentials, dreams, or futures with energy, words, or systems. Not just bodies—do not murder innocence; you murder someone every single time you choose to intentionally harm someone. That is why natural law doctrine exists. Every act of trafficking, false-flag bombing, and war is a complete violation of human’s natural principle to refuse harm on all scales.</li>
            <li>Stay loyal to yourself – chase your path, not someone else’s; remain faithful to your soul mission. Don’t abandon your higher self for temporary illusions, power, money, comfort, or distractions—every betrayal of sovereignty is adultery against your own calling which leaches into becoming adultery with another being.</li>
            <li>Don’t take what isn’t yours – no stealing energy, ideas, trust, love, time, land, children, or sovereignty. Exchange must be sacred. Income tax, land titles, birth-certificate contracts, central-bank debt are all theft on a planetary scale and Sovereign Law is essential to abolish this vampire system entirely.</li>
            <li>Tell it straight. Be real with no restraints or masks. No cover-ups, no gaslighting, no “official” stories omitting truths speaking partiality; lies that cause harm are treason. Lies must ONLY be spoken to survive death. Integrity is absolute. Speak truth; every cover-up or ignoring of child abuse, fraudulent court document, paid media narrative; it all fractures reality and disconnects from source, you, self, I AM, and humanity will NOT stand for it any longer.</li>
            <li>Want what you have – comparison kills; scarcity is the illusion fueling war, greed, division—abundance is inside you already. You lack nothing. You are complete, full and perfect as your imperfect self. You are perfectly accepted, loved, respected, and adored for who you are and the beauty you radiate within you. Your light is absolutely gorgeous. You are perfectly shaped and designed exactly as you are meant to be. And you are an exceptional being as your embodied whole, health balanced sovereign self. Every need is given to you upon commanding authority. Wants are sub factor worked towards; basic human needs however are non-negotiable.; In the quantum field, what is yours is aligned—coveting is the root of all division, and it is extinguished now.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>These codes are the operating system of a sane Earth. Live them as consciousness, and death, sickness, tyranny become impossible. Simplicity is the kill-shot; complexity was the weapon.</p>

        <p>These are mandatory upon activation; violation constitutes harm triggering immediate intervention.</p>

        <h2>Article VI: Universal Governance – Sacred Healing Councils</h2>

        <p>Sacred Healing Councils replace every parliament, court, bureaucracy, and tribunal. One council per community, neighborhood, or block—open to every adult and child, chosen by lot or direct vote, rotate every year, and instant recall. Decisions by simple majority or consensus; everything live-streamed and blockchain vote recorded. No more permanent politicians, parties, or elites. Global Council links every local council—same rules, same transparency. No separate indigenous, immigrant, veteran, disability, or ANY governments—ONE LAW, ONE PEOPLE. Flat, rotating structure, crushes corruption; all decisions transparent, auditable 24/7 via blockchain.</p>

        <p>Councils handle every sector: family protections universal (kinship/reunification for all); human rights tribunals cover every infringement (discrimination, abuse, rights violations) without limits; environmental stewardship (pollution/harm = treason against life); every human stewards Earth as kin as his own family and being.</p>

        <p>Integration of all traditions (harmony with land, non-discrimination, family reunification, refugee sanctuary, economic contribution) adapted universally—no exclusive rule, no silos, no exploitation, no elite filters.</p>

        <p>One unified dominion ends division. Kids sit at the table when sacred councils speak—age is irrelevant; if a five-year-old says they are hurt, investigations are same-day, same hour, act expediently—no dismissal, no too young excuse; immediate action. A child's single disclosure of harm triggers immediate investigation and protective measures.</p>

        <p>Integrated safeguards: Conflict-of-interest prohibition, transparent records, recall mechanisms, append-only corrections.</p>

        <h2>Article VII: Universal Human Rights – Iron-Clad, Irrevocable from Birth</h2>

        <p>These rights are unalienable, belonging to every human being universally, with zero exceptions for status or belief. No government grants or revokes them. Violate one? Face the hammer.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Right to life, bodily integrity, and self-defense.</li>
            <li>Right to liberty and free movement – no borders, no passports.</li>
            <li>Right to equality – no discrimination of any kind.</li>
            <li>Right to family – immediate reunification for every family, no sponsorship, no paperwork maze.</li>
            <li>Right to truth – full transparency in all matters.</li>
            <li>Right to natural healing – free access to plant medicine, clean food, water, air; no forced procedure or substance.</li>
            <li>Right to sustenance – unrestricted hunting, fishing, and gathering for all.</li>
            <li>Right to bear arms for protection and sustenance – no licenses.</li>
            <li>Right to fair, swift justice in Sacred Healing Councils – no judges, no juries.</li>
            <li>Right to stewardship of Earth – polluters face immediate removal and restoration duty.</li>
            <li>Right to raise your children without state interference unless harm is proven – kids voice danger too, it must be taken seriously. They are human also, Minor or not, their voice is equally as respected as an adults is.</li>
            <li>Right to refuse any medical procedure or substance – your veto is absolute.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Enforced mandatorily; child's voice equals adult's; single disclosure triggers immediate protective action.</p>

        <h2>Article VIII: Universal Justice – Simple, Intent-Based, Final</h2>

        <p>Intent is everything.</p>

        <p>Predators (rapists, child molesters, traffickers, sadists): Faced with 5 years of mandatory natural healing incarceration → if they’re still dangerous after 5 years → humane euthanasia.</p>

        <p>Protective killing (stopping active evil): mental healing, punishment is not given, healing is.</p>

        <p>All other harms: restitution + healing circles. No prisons are punishment, instead only healing enclaves for the incurable. Mandatory sterilization only for those who remain a proven danger to humanity, making humanity vulnerable to their potential danger they could presume if repeat harm ensues which is a security danger of humanity impose on all.</p>

        <p>Enclaves are self-governing villages—gardens, workshops, libraries, sports—no bars, just locked gates to keep outsiders safe. Inside: full rights—work, vote, learn, love adults—except reproduction and child contact is removed. No torture, no endless lockdown—just space, tools, and years to prove you won’t hurt again and have healed.</p>

        <p>Refuse or incapable of healing? Euthanasia is mercy, not punishment. Three strikes for non-predatory harms, zero cages. 5 years is the cap for essential humane action and national protection from harm in those isolated society enclaves; After 5 years of consistent harm mentality with no hope of restoration, humane euthanasia.</p>

        <p>Two enclave societies: those who are in active harm mindset actively being given their humanly needs to heal, and enclaves for those harmers who have healed but are a breach to humanities safety indefinitely. All are treated fully ethical regardless of their crimes, all are treated as human beings whom were unfortunate to become sick and ensure intentional harm.</p>

        <p>Every human has the right and responsibility to intervene proportionally against imminent harm, including lethal force if necessary to preserve life, ceasing upon safety secured. No hierarchy—equal sovereign duty for all.</p>

        <p>Integrated safeguards: All interventions documented, reviewable by councils, append-only records, no punishment motive.</p>

        <h2>Article IX: Universal Land, Food, and Weapons</h2>

        <p>All land titles abolished from private ownership – stewardship only. Every human may hunt, fish, gather, and bear arms without license or restriction. Indigenous traditional rights to hunt and live off the land extended identically and without discrimination to every man, woman, and child on the planet.</p>

        <p>Crown Land ends: every acre—forest, lake, field— if vacant for two weeks with no notice posted of established habitat with temporary absence? Then that land if fair game to walk on, pitch a tent, build a cabin. No deed. No fence. No cop knocks. No permits for chopping green wood, wiring your cabin, or running your pipe. Build with what the land gives—your sweat, your risk, your call. Homeless? Not anymore. Earth is ours to breathe, not anyone’s to hoard.</p>

        <h2>Article X: Universal Medicine</h2>

        <p>All pharmaceutical poison banned. Natural healing (plants, frequency, diet, ceremony) is the only medicine. Free healing gardens and Sacred Healing Councils in every community. Consent first, always.</p>

        <h2>Article XI: Abolishing Wars – Immediate Shutdown Protocol</h2>

        <p>Dismantle roots: borders, resource hoarding, elite control.</p>

        <p>Day 1: Borders void—free movement starves nationalism.</p>

        <p>Day 7: Global boycotts and blockchain freezes on arms/fuel accounts; $50B+ aid to terrorists diverted to healing.</p>

        <p>Day 14: All armies disbanded into Peace & Rescue Networks—trained in de-escalation, empathy; disarm hot zones, rescue victims.</p>

        <p>Day 30: Every ongoing war starved of money, fuel, recruits. Any leader ordering violence after Day 30 declared predator and removed. Resource stewardship shares everything universally; councils mediate disputes with truth circles. No ego battles. No guns; love’s tools only. Absolute communication NOT ego power hungry fights and wars.</p>

        <p>Ongoing enforcement: Any war act = treason under Do No Harm Commandment; perpetrators face healing in enclaves or euthanasia.</p>

        <p>Blockchain tracks compliance—global transparency prevents secret wars. Ends all current wars (Ukraine, Gaza) within 90 days; false flags exposed as treason. Love conquers—permanently. Territorial and Religion fights are abolished forever.</p>

        <h2>Article XII: Every Sector of Law Replaced by Natural Law</h2>

        <p>All old codes abolished.</p>

        <p>Criminal Code → Do No Harm and intent-based justice.</p>

        <p>Family Law → universal: child’s best interest, kinship continuity, immediate reunification, no state interference unless proven harm; council-based custody with kid’s voice first, age zero counts; separation = six months re-train stipend, then independence—no gold-digger payouts.</p>

        <p>Human Rights Tribunals → cover every infringement (not just employment); instant standing.</p>

        <p>Real Estate Law → all private titles abolished; universal stewardship.</p>

        <p>Civil/Common Law → precedent abolished; disputes solved in councils.</p>

        <p>Firearms & Hunting → unrestricted for all.</p>

        <p>Immigration → borders abolished; free movement.</p>

        <p>Mental Health → forced treatment banned; healing only with consent or imminent danger; council decides in one day, hold only if suicidal or violent now—24-hour clock; release with bed, job, circle plan—no psych ward warehouses.</p>

        <p>Environmental Law → pollution/harm = treason.</p>

        <p>Residential Law → rent locked at entry cost, inflation banned, evictions only for destruction; tenants veto increases; rent = (actual upkeep + labor @ $15/hr or minimum wage ) / tenants – 25% community subsidy; landlord compensated for effort, no profit—quarterly audit, gouge = drop or sell.</p>

        <p>Insurance Act → community-backed, flat-rate; faulted by physics (brake marks, crush math, speed vectors), intent (tone, history), not policy—footage/witness optional; negligence proven, not printed; payout from pool. Mortgage/Capital Debt → no banks, no interest; need roof/wheels? Council approves, community pays real cost—no markup.</p>

        <p>Old-Age/Pension → councils calculate real need (food, heat, meds, roof)—covered by community vault; no retirement poverty; contribute if able.</p>

        <p>Disability/Veteran → real-time stipend (medical, rent, food, tools, ramps, chairs, lifts)—direct, no forms; no negligent label.</p>

        <p>Transport → no revenue policing; no fines for taillights, tires, seatbelts, plates, registration; drive sober/steady—council handles reckless reports.</p>

        <p>Integrated safeguards: Rotation, audits, conflict rules in all processes.</p>

        <h2>Article XIII: Peace Force – Protect, Not Predate</h2>

        <p>Councils spawn rotating civilians, one-year terms, instant recall. No uniforms, crowns, guns unless harm is live. Vow: Love, Serve, Protect. Stop active harm; de-escalation first. No routine stops, revenue tickets, asset grabs.</p>

        <p>Civilian arrest: any human seeing rape/assault/threat can tackle, tie, drag to council or kill if absolutely necessary for threat to life. Peace Force history burned—no oaths to kings, no hospital-drug cover-ups, no forensic evidence as rape license.</p>

        <p>Report harm: council locks room, forensics sealed, bodycam live, Peace Force guards with zero retaliation tolerance. Gang-rape whistle-blower? Instant enclave.</p>

        <p>Every human has equal duty to intervene proportionally.</p>

        <h2>Article XIV: Economic Rebellion – Starfish App & Community Fund Vaults</h2>

        <p>Consumer Rebellion, currency “Starfish” platform founded by Orrin Woodward: e-transfer in, safe anonymous spending, and snatch 2-3% cashback banks and credit card companies stole—now yours.</p>

        <p>$70/year customer fee but it pays for itself (if you spend $145 in a month = you are given $7 back every month); one-time membership fees and paying same as customer fees for membership annually going forth unless member chooses higher bracket payout and monthly fees voluntarily ($200-ish with books/taxes for membership costs) unlocks tiers; members and customers hit $100-$450/month in savings and membership perks which translates to spendable currency towards your spending needs. No tracking, no ID leash—privacy-first. Completely anonymous.</p>

        <p>Cash gap: community kiosks for bill drops (QR instant-load); crypto bridges (Monero/Zcash for anon top-ups).</p>

        <p>This platform has no full bank—it completely sidestep regulations and the painful slowly enforced enslaving digital identification.</p>

        <p>Once 51% vote hits, legislate exemptions: peer vaults everywhere, one-world currency without chains, no borders on bucks, no poverty traps. Vaults in every block: physical cash, anonymous crypto, Starfish chips.</p>

        <p>Community Funds: 25% rent subsidy to lower income bracket, disability/veteran/old-age stipends ($2,200 base compensation), roads/bridges, forensics, emergencies are funded by community fund from 11% flat tithe on all income—no brackets, capped at $300/month; if under $1,500/month income, tithe is waived, council covers.</p>

        <p>Flow: Starfish auto-scrapes 2-4% per transaction on fuel and 7-10% on amenities; rent surplus drips; homeowners and renters contribute labor ($15/hr or agreed minimum wage pay towards community fund at community agreed upon duration) or minimum $250/month towards community funds; universal micro-tax $50/month (anonymous) funding global movements of liberty and restoration. Miss two months? Work off dues in labour or relocate to Crown land emancipating from community support and rescinding all rights to community currency support. Any community humanly need will be established at a set flat rate for services utilized by those humans whom emancipate selves from society.</p>

        <p>Transparency: blockchain live feed, no names.</p>

        <p>Inflow dip? Community votes all adjustments. It’s not tax—it’s heartbeat money: everyone contributes, no one starves.</p>

        <h2>Article XV: Activation and Operations Checklist – Step-by-Step Implementation of Every Clause</h2>

        <p>This checklist orchestrates all clauses into practical, sequential steps for global rollout, preserving full substance without repetition or stripping.</p>

        <p>Order: immediate activation, governance setup, sector replacements, enforcement, economic flow, justice/medicine/land rollout, war abolition, ongoing operations.</p>

        <p>No changes to established strategy—execute as written, respecting sovereign self-governance, atheist-majority neutrality, children’s voices, and universal equality.</p>

        <h1>SOVEREIGN SECULAR AFFIRMATION</h1>

        <h2>Religious Objection to Oaths, Solemn Affirmations, and Commissioned Verification of Documents Based on Sincerely Held Beliefs</h2>

        <p>The undersigned submits this document in support of the position that requiring a witness, deponent, or filer to swear an oath, make a solemn affirmation, or have documents verified by a Commissioner of Oaths or Notary Public infringes upon sincerely held religious beliefs protected under section 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (freedom of conscience and religion). This objection extends explicitly to solemn affirmations, which—despite their secular form—remain ritualistic promises that elevate a special formula above plain speech, thereby presuming potential dishonesty (i.e., guilt of falsehood) before any evidence, and conflicting with divine commands against any form of oath-taking or extra validation.</p>

        <h2>Relevant Constitutional Provisions from the Constitution Act, 1982</h2>

        <p>The Constitution Act, 1982, Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11, includes Part I, commonly known as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Preamble states: “Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law.”</p>

        <p>Section 1 provides: “The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.”</p>

        <p>Section 2 states: “Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: (a) freedom of conscience and religion; (b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication; (c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and (d) freedom of association.”</p>

        <p>Section 7: “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.”</p>

        <p>Section 15(1): “Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.”</p>

        <p>Section 24(1): “Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.”</p>

        <p>Section 27: “This Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians.”</p>

        <h2>Purpose and Analytical Framework for Section 2(a) – Freedom of Conscience and Religion</h2>

        <p>The purpose of section 2(a) is to prevent interference with profoundly held personal beliefs that govern one’s perception of oneself, humankind, nature, and, in some cases, a higher or different order of being (Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem, 2004 SCC 47).</p>

        <p>Freedom of religion includes the right to entertain such religious beliefs as a person chooses, to declare them openly without fear of hindrance or reprisal, and to manifest them by worship, practice, teaching, or dissemination (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 SCR 295).</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court of Canada has established a test for infringement under section 2(a):</p>

        <p>An infringement is established where:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The claimant sincerely believes in a belief or practice that has a nexus with religion; and</li>
            <li>The impugned measure interferes with the claimant’s ability to act in accordance with their religious beliefs in a manner that is more than trivial or insubstantial.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>State neutrality requires neither favouring nor hindering any particular belief, showing respect for all postures toward religion, including none (Mouvement laïque québécois v. Saguenay (City), 2015 SCC 16).</p>

        <h2>Sincerely Held Religious Belief and Scriptural Basis for Objection</h2>

        <p>The undersigned sincerely holds that any requirement to swear an oath, make a solemn affirmation, or submit to external validation (such as commissioning) violates religious conscience. This includes solemn affirmations, which—though presented as secular alternatives—constitute the same prohibited ritual: a formalized, elevated promise to tell the truth that implies one’s ordinary word is insufficiently trustworthy unless accompanied by this special declaration.</p>

        <p>This belief is grounded in a direct interpretation of Matthew 5:33-37: “Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne: Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.”</p>

        <p>The command is absolute—no oaths, no elevated promises, no additional formulas beyond plain speech. Adding any ritualistic wording (including “I solemnly affirm…”) creates a double standard of truthfulness, presuming that everyday statements may be false unless reinforced by ceremony. This presumption treats the speaker as potentially guilty of dishonesty before any proof, inverting principles of justice and equality.</p>

        <p>Such rituals are further viewed as idolatrous, placing human or procedural authority above divine simplicity and elevating a man-made formula to a status of greater validity than God’s command for unadorned honesty. This echoes the First Commandment against having other gods or idols before the Lord (Exodus 20:3), as the ritual becomes an object of reliance superior to plain truth.</p>

        <p>The same concern applies to commissioned verification, which requires third-party vouching—again presuming guilt until an authorized person stamps approval.</p>

        <h2>Examples from scripture reinforce that plain speech suffices:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Jesus’ repeated use of “Verily, verily, I say unto you” without oaths or affirmations (e.g., John 1:51, 13:16, 13:20, 13:21, 13:38).</li>
            <li>In Matthew 26:62-70, Jesus responds in court with simple statements (“Thou hast said”) without any oath, affirmation, or ritual validation, and his words are accepted as binding without contempt charges for lack of form.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>John 1:1-18 and Genesis teachings on humanity made in God’s image further support that humans possess inherent dominion and integrity; no external ritual or presumption of guilt is needed to validate truth.</p>

        <h2>Historical Context: Quaker Experience and the Limits of Affirmation</h2>

        <p>Historical Quaker refusal of oaths led to the creation of solemn affirmations as an accommodation. However, this accommodation falls short for those holding a stricter biblical view, as the affirmation remains a ritualistic promise—still “more than” simple yea/nay—that presumes distrust and requires a special formula. The undersigned’s belief aligns with the original Quaker principle but goes further, rejecting affirmations as equally prohibited.</p>

        <h2>Relevant Statutory Provisions Demonstrating Flexibility</h2>

        <p>Under the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Section 714.5 allows evidence from witnesses outside Canada to be given in any other manner demonstrating understanding of the duty to tell the truth.</li>
            <li>Section 846 permits electronic documents with statements true to knowledge and belief.</li>
            <li>Section 508.1(2) allows statements true to knowledge and belief, deemed as under oath.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These provisions illustrate that Canadian law already contemplates flexible acceptance of plain declarations without oaths or affirmations.</p>

        <h2>Requested Accommodation</h2>

        <p>The undersigned respectfully requests that the Court accommodate this sincere belief by accepting statements, affidavits, declarations, or testimony as fully binding upon:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A plain declaration that the contents are true to the best of the undersigned’s knowledge and belief;</li>
            <li>Clear identification of the undersigned;</li>
            <li>Signature and date.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>No oath, solemn affirmation, or commissioned verification should be required. This minimal accommodation eliminates ritual, removes presumption of guilt, respects Charter-protected conscience, and poses no undue hardship to the administration of justice, given existing statutory flexibility and perjury consequences for falsehoods.</p>

        <h2>Declaration</h2>

        <p>The contents of this submission and any related documents are true to the best of my knowledge and belief. I understand the legal consequences of providing false information to the Court.</p>

        <p>Dated at City of  __________________, in the County of _________________  Province of _________________________, this ______ day of ___________________, 2026.</p>
