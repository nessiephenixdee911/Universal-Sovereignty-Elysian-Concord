<h2>Doctrine (Canonical Text)</h2>
<pre class="doctrine">UNIVERSAL SOVEREIGNTY ELYSIAN CONCORD: GLOBAL PEACE CHARTER

BREAKING: ITS VOTING TIME!

One law: Do NO harm. Love.

Testimony: 12 years of my daughter abused by known pedophiles. Friend murdered protecting us. Police framed, beat, gang-raped me in custody. Recent AK47 and grenade threats; police tried psych jail silence. Insurance denied support; near homeless, abandoned. System protects predators.

We are done.

Activates when global legislation in each Nation mandates adoption by at least half its divisions with 51% majority vote.

Then:

• Borders, taxes, prisons, pharma die.
• Councils replace governments—rotating, transparent, open to children.
• Child's single disclosure = immediate protection.
• Every human's equal duty: intervene against harm—lethal force if life-threatened.
• Predators to enclaves: 5 years healing or humane euthanasia.
• Ten Laws of Love mandatory.
• Land free, arms free, natural healing free.
• Wars ended in 30 days.

Constituent power revoking tyranny.

Mandatory for survival.

Vote YES. Share now.

Old world ends at threshold.

We stop obeying.

<h2>Legally Binding Global Vote</h2>
<p>
This vote constitutes a declaration of constituent power withdrawal and
non‑state electoral formation. Once 51% adoption is reached across 50%
of global divisions, this charter becomes immediately binding under
natural law, self‑determination doctrine, and international customary law.
